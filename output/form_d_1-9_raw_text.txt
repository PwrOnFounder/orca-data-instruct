1         Overview
The Form D data provides information extracted from Form D XML submissions in a flattened data format to
assist users in more easily consuming the data for analysis. These data includes any amendments to those
submissions. The data has been taken directly from submissions created by the registrants and provided as-
filed. The data will be published quarterly. Data contained in documents filed after 5:30pm EST on the last
business day of the quarter will be included in the next quarterly posting.

DISCLAIMER: The Form D Data contains information derived from structured data filed with the Commission
by individual registrants as well as Commission-generated filing identifiers. Because the data is derived from
information provided by individual registrants, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the data. In addition, it is
possible inaccuracies or other errors were introduced into the data during the process of extracting the data
and compiling. Finally, the data does not reflect all available information, including certain metadata
associated with Commission filings. The data is intended to assist the public in analyzing data contained in
Commission filings; however, it is not a substitute for such filings. Investors should review the full Commission
filings before making any investment decision.

The data extracted from the Form D XML submissions is organized into six tab-delimited TXT format files as
follows:

•         FORMDSUBMISSION




•         ISSUERS

•         OFFERING

•         RECIPIENTS

•         RELATEDPERSONS

•         SIGNATURES

2         Scope
The Form D Data consists of XML data submitted from Jan 2008 through current period.

The Form D Data publishing files do not include data from attachments or other optional information that may
have been included in a submission.

Note:  The EDGAR Form D XML Technical Specification provides additional information regarding the Form D
submissions.

3         Organization
Note that the data includes Form D information "as filed" in EDGAR document submissions including
amendments of prior submissions.  Data in this submitted form may contain redundancies, inconsistencies,
and discrepancies relative to prior submissions and other publication formats.  There are six data files.  Each
quarterly data is accompanied by a metadata file conforming to the W3C specification for tabular data
(https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-tabular-data-model-20151217/ ) that encodes the following information
about the data files and their relationships to each other.

1.    FORMDSUBMISSION identifies the Form D EDGAR XML submissions, with each row having the

primary key ACCESSIONNUMBER.

2.    ISSUERS data is the issuer information for each submission, with each row having the primary key

ACCESSIONNUMBER and ISSUER_SEQ_KEY.

3.    OFFERING data is the offering information, with each row having the primary key

ACCESSIONNUMBER.

4.    RECIPIENTS data contains recipients’ information related to the submissions, with each row having

the primary key ACCESSIONNUMBER and RECIPIENT_SEQ_KEY.

5.    RELATEDPERSONS data contains information of related persons in a submission, with each row

having the primary key ACCESSIONNUMBER and RELATEDPERSON_SEQ_KEY.

6.    SIGNATURES data provides the data from the person signatures, with each row having the primary

key ACCESSIONNUMBER and SIGNATURE_SEQ_KEY.

ACCESSIONNUMBER can be used to retrieve information about a submission in the data
files.  ACCESSIONNUMBER and XXX_SEQ_KEY can be used to obtain data reported on multiple lines in
the submission.

4         File Formats

Each of the six data files provide text format, tab delimited, utf-8 encoding.

5         File Header Definitions
The fields in the figures below (figures 1 - 6) provide the following information: field name, description, data
format, maximum field size, an indication of whether or not the field may be NULL (yes or no), and key.

The Key field indicates whether the field is part of a unique index on the data.  There are two possible values
for this field:

•         "*"   Indicates the field is part of the unique key for the row.

•         Empty (nothing in field)   the field is not part of the unique compound key.
